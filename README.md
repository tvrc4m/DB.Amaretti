# DB.Ameretti
A Amaretti Orchard 1.10 Front End Theme.
This is not free to use. If you want to use it on porduction it will cost you $18.00 and its well worth it.
Amaretti is a Admin Theme you can buy at Wrap Bootstrap https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/amaretti-responsive-admin-template-WB0696K5S

Go to my test site to view DB.Amaretti at http://publiuslogic.com or in production at http://donboulton.com

Still working on placement.info and Alternitive Shapes and has one glitch.
I havent figured out whats up with SideBarTabThree as it does not display a widget.
Need to add user profile image to to nav and clean up db.amaretti.css file.

Any feedback is welcome.

Enjoy
