# DB.Ameretti
A Amaretti Orchard 1.10 Front End Theme.
This is not free to use. If you want to use it on production it will cost you $18.00 and its well worth it.
Check it out on a Moblie or Touch device.

Amaretti is a Admin Theme you can buy at Wrap Bootstrap https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/amaretti-responsive-admin-template-WB0696K5S

Go to my test site to view DB.Amaretti at http://publiuslogic.com or in production at http://donboulton.com

Still working on placement.info and Alternitive Shapes and this theme has one glitch;
I have not figured out whats up with SideBarTabThree as it does not display a widget???
Need to add user profile image to to nav and clean up db.amaretti.css file.
Alternative Shape for Zen Gallery, using photoswipe and filtered by isotope.
Alternative Shapes for Latest.Twitter.Widget, Blog posts, Comments, Lists, LogOn, Register.
The Register.cshtml has Two Fields that you need to add to ContentType User and that is First Name and Last Name, and to display your profile image you need to add a Media Library Picker field for your User Profile Image to the User Content Type with a Name of Profile Image
Top nav Zones are unordered lists, If you ever added a HTML Menu item to Orchard Menu then you know to start this list with list item.
Adding Shapes for Theme.Switcher which changes Themes; using alternitive theme.css files or do it yourself with .less files. 
A Theme Settings Shape ThemeSettings.cshtml and Settings.json file, for IDeliverable.ThemeSettings Module to change base colors: https://github.com/IDeliverable/IDeliverable.ThemeSettings

Any feedback is welcome.

Enjoy
