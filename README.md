# DB.Ameretti
A Amaretti Orchard 1.10 Front End Theme.
This is not free to use. If you want to use it on porduction it will cost you $18.00 and its well worth it.
Amaretti is a Admin Theme you can buy at Wrap Bootstrap https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/amaretti-responsive-admin-template-WB0696K5S

Go to my test site to view DB.Amaretti at http://publiuslogic.com or in production at http://donboulton.com

Still working on placement.info and Alternitive Shapes and this theme has one glitch;
I havent figured out whats up with SideBarTabThree as it does not display a widget.
Need to add user profile image to to nav and clean up db.amaretti.css file.
Alternative Shape for Zen Gallery, using photoswipe and filtered by isotope.
Alternative Shapes for Latest.Twitter.Widget, Blog posts, Comments, Lists, LogOn, Register.
Adding Shapes for Theme.Switcher which changes Themes; using alternitive theme.css files or do it yourself with .less files. 
A Theme Settings Shape ThemeSettings.cshtml and Settings.json file, for IDeliverable.ThemeSettings Module: https://github.com/IDeliverable/IDeliverable.ThemeSettings

Any feedback is welcome.

Enjoy
